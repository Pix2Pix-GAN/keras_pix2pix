# Keras implementation of a pix2pix GAN for image-to-image translation

This repository provides a keras implementation of a [pix2pix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004) and tests it by performing image-to-image translation on publicly available data.

## Corresponding blog post:

The results presented in this repository are explained in detail in this [blog post](https://nchlis.github.io/2019_11_22/page.html).

## Available models:

Only the trained keras model for the downsized GAN is available in the repo, since the rest of the models exceed the maximum size (100MB) GitHub allows for a single file.
